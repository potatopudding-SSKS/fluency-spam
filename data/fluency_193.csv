 <p style=""font-size:20px;""> ‎</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> Before we walk you through the tasks you will be doing, we would like to get a sense of what</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> content you typically consume on the Reddit platform. On the preceeding page, we ask that you</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> input the names of the Subreddits you typically engage with in any capacity. (i.e. writing posts,</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> reading posts, upvoting, commenting, sharing, etc.) On the page following that, we ask that you input</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> your general interests, independent of specific Subreddits. To input a response, type it within the </p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> provided box and <strong>press ENTER</strong> after every response. Keep in mind, there will be a three minute</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> time limit. However, if you feel you are done before time runs out, <strong>press Continue</strong>. This data</p>
 <p style=""font-size:18px;""> is crucial to the experiment, so please be as accurate possible when typing your responses.</p>
